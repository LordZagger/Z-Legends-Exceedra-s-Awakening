# Fall 2024 CHE120 Game Project: Z-Legends: Exceedra's Awakening
V1.0
Game Project due Dec. 3rd, 2024 for CHE120: Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers
Game made by Jeremy Bijoux (LordZagger) and Jinyong Lee (Jin4843), just because we wanted to make our own game (and Jeremy wanted to make the soundtrack) and for bonus marks ;)
This is to track the progress of who did what in making the game, as well as a place to store all the images and files used in-game
Of course, the GitHub reposity also has the python game file

wav files are music, png files are images, py file is the game, and please check out the pdf Rulebook for more detailed instructions on how to play

V1.1
There were issues with the game on the release of Dec 3rd (only part of episode 1), so Jeremy fixed the issues of Episode 1 from Dec 24-27
We recommend playing the game on a software like Spyder, as there are some console prompts to keep track off during battles

V1.2 - Jan 18, 2025
(Oh boy... I really hope I don't forget to mention something...)
This update adds 2 new modes to the game (Boss Rush and Custom Battle, see Rulebook), changes some functions around, etc. I'll try to name them all.
-Boss Rush mode, Custom Battle mode available after beating Episode 1
-Destiny, Overlord and Dark Exceedra (who are supposed to appear as playable in Episode 2) are available early in Custom Battle
-updated sound for Nightmare's death
-after winning a battle, or hearing Nightmare's Screams, the game pauses until the sound is over before you can move on with dialogue
-the reset function no longer returns a new character, now it just sets the health and energy to the ogs (which should help save memory)
-character battle positions updated for boss rush and custom battles
-a bunch of docstrings for functions were updated
-canon stats characters as CH1 for Custom Battle
-new functions (e.g. wait and resetAll, which combine other functions/methods into one function so we don't take a lot of lines to repeat the same blocks of code in the main while loop)
-more preparations for future episodes planted inside the code
-credits function was completed (but not yet used ingame) 
-other minor changes to variables (e.g. no more while running, now the main loop is while True, and running has been removed

The next update (hopefully very soon) will have more themes for Episode 1, and with the updated OST, Episode 1 will TRULY be completed.
Enjoy! -LordZagger (I'm not related to the characters btw)
