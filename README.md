# Fall 2024 CHE120 Game Project: Z-Legends: Exceedra's Awakening
**V1.0
Game Project due Dec. 3rd, 2024 for CHE120: Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers**

Game made by Jeremy Bijoux (LordZagger) and Jinyong Lee (Jin4843), just because we wanted to make our own game (and Jeremy wanted to make the soundtrack) and for bonus marks ;)

This is to track the progress of who did what in making the game (or so we intended), as well as a place to store all the images and files

Of course, the GitHub reposity also has the python game file

wav files are music, png files are images, py file is the game, and please check out the pdf Rulebook for more detailed instructions on how to play and the story setting


**V1.1**

There were issues with the game on the release of Dec 3rd (only part of episode 1), so Jeremy fixed the issues of Episode 1 from Dec 24-27

We recommend playing the game on a software like Spyder, as there are some console prompts to keep track off during battles


**V1.2 - Jan 18, 2025**

(Oh boy... I really hope I don't forget to mention something...)

This update adds 2 new modes to the game (Boss Rush and Custom Battle, see Rulebook), changes some functions around, etc. I'll try to name them all.

-Boss Rush mode, Custom Battle mode available after beating Episode 1 (temporary: in the final version, these will be unlockable once the story is completed)

-Destiny, Overlord and Dark Exceedra (who are supposed to appear as playable in Episode 2) are available early in Custom Battle

-updated sound for Nightmare's death

-after winning a battle, or hearing Nightmare's Screams, the game pauses until the sound is over before you can move on with dialogue

-the reset function no longer returns a new character, now it just sets the health and energy to the ogs (which should help save memory)

-character battle positions updated for boss rush and custom battles

-a bunch of docstrings for functions were updated

-canon stats characters as CH1 for Custom Battle

-new functions (e.g. wait and resetAll, which combine other functions/methods into one function so we don't take a lot of lines to repeat the same blocks of code in the main while loop)
-more preparations for future episodes planted inside the code
-credits function was completed (but not yet used ingame) 
-other minor changes to variables (e.g. no more while running, now the main loop is while True, and running has been removed)

The next update (hopefully very soon) will have more themes for Episode 1, and with the updated OST, Episode 1 will TRULY be completed.
Enjoy! -LordZagger (I'm not related to the characters btw)

**V1.3 - May 8, 2025**

Done. At long last done. Episode 1 OST is complete!!! Episode 1 is complete!!!!!! I had hoped that after releasing V1.3 I would get right on the OST... But I procrastinated. And co-op also got busy. But here we are! Not just with a completed OST for Episode 1, but some more good news:

- Updated rulebook, which will especially help for some new additions to the story and Custom Battle mode

- Minor changes to comments

- Dialogue improvements

- Exceedra vs Akobos has been changed to Exceedra and Hydranoid vs Akobos (a 2 vs 1, to match the story)

- Dark Exceedra cut from Custom Battle (it's just not right to have him there without his sprite)

- The old version of the reset method is back! This time, it's actually useful, since we need it to make clones of characters in some instances of Custom Battle

- Custom and Random characters in Custom Battle! You may now design your own fighter (following rulebook and console prompts instructions), or use any random available character (top-left yellow buttons on character select screen)

- Canon characters added to the lot of available Custom Battle fighters in addition to the energy-overloaded versions (a decision was made to use C characters as lore-accurate or easier versions of the opponent, and the energy-overloaded versions are used as tougher opponents)

Alright, this is where things get serious. Though this file doesn't show it, we are actually very advanced into the coding of episodes 2-4. Honestly, we're almost done.
The story has all been mapped out. The plan for the OST was made. Literally, all that is left to do is write the story, finish the OST, finish the character and background drawings. We can then fill in/replace some variables' assignments and add the proper character placements and story cues in the code... and we're done.

One of my New Year's Resolution is to finish the game by the end of the year. Is it possible? Yes. Will it happen? It ultimately depends on how cooked we are for 1B, and then how much we procrastinate during our Fall co-op. Another thing is that we are undecided as to whether or not to release Episodes 2-4 one at a time, or all at once...

Well, enjoy version 1.3! And look forward to the next update!
